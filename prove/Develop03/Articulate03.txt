Encapsulation - Articulate

What is encapsulation and why is it important?

. Explain the meaning of Encapsulation
It is interesting that the word itself indicates what encapsulation is. 
Refers to enclosing something so that other code can't use or see it.
Within the programming, it indicates that we hide information 
and access control, for example of a class.

. Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation
I think that some points that give importance to encapsulation 
would be in cases where something is not working well, we can 
quickly identify where the error is because not all the codes have 
access and if we need to correct something we can go directly to the codes 
have access to make the necessary adjustments.

. Provide an application of Encapsulation
A general rule, for example, is that attributes (or member variables) 
should be private. The other classes do not have to know how 
the class has stored its information.

public class Person
{
    private string _title;
    private string _firstName;
    private string _lastName;

}


. Use a code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote
One of the examples where I used encapsulation in my code was when 
I defined some of the member variables of the Scripture class:

public class Scripture
{    
    ...
    private string _fileName = "ScriptureLibrary.txt";
    private string _key;
    private string _text;
    ...
}


(Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words))
