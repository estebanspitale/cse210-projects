Inheritance - Articulate

What is inheritance and why is it important?

. Explain the meaning of Inheritance
Inheritance is a principle that has the ability to, as the word indicates, 
inherit from another class, attributes and 
methods without having to rewrite them. It is the same as 
the concept of inheritance between parents and children.

. Highlight a benefit of Inheritance
I think one of the biggest benefits is that it saves us 
from writing code by being able to use the one inherited from 
the parent class. It becomes a means to reuse code

. Provide an application of Inheritance
An example of Inheritance is when we have two classes, 
one Person and the other Patient. The person class will have 
its own tributes from any person and the patient class inherits 
those attributes from the person class and adds its own attributes 
and methods such as membership card number, type of social work, etc.

. Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote
public class BreathingActivity : Activity
{ 
    private string _mess1 = "Breathe in...";
    private string _mess2 = "Breathe out...";
    private string _description = "This activity will help you relax...
    .
    .
    .
}

For example this code shows how the BreathingActivity class inherits 
attributes and methods from the Activity class


(Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words))
